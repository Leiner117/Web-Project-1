        <h1>A Journey Through Time: The History of Rome</h1>
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <p>
          Rome was founded over 2,700 years ago. According to legend, it was
          established by Romulus in 753 BC. What began as a small village
          eventually became the capital of the greatest empire of the ancient
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking through its streets feels like wandering through an open-air
          museum. The Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon are just a
          few of the many landmarks that echo the grandeur of ancient Rome.
          Every stone tells a story, every corner holds the secrets of emperors,
          gladiators, and gods.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The history of Rome spans over a thousand years, during which it
          transformed from a monarchy to a republic and later to an empire that
          ruled much of the known world."
          <cite>Wikipedia - Ancient Rome</cite>

        </div>
        <p>
          What makes Rome truly special is that its culture is still alive. The
          city pulses with creativity, tradition, and everyday life. The legacy
          of the empire mingles with the hustle of markets, street performers,
          and trattorias rich with aroma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rome inherited many ideas and styles from the Greeks but added its own
          touch. From arches and grand avenues to public baths and laws, its
          influence continues to shape the modern world.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "The Romans greatly benefited from their contact with Greek culture,
          which they deeply admired. Yet they developed their own culture,
          centered on practicality and organization."
          <cite>El Historiador</cite>

        </div>
        <p>
          Religion has always been part of Roman life. From ancient gods to the
          rise of Christianity, Rome became the spiritual heart of the Catholic
          world. St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican are living witnesses of
          this deep connection between faith and art.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "In the 4th century, Christianity was officially adopted by Emperor
          Constantine and became the state religion."
